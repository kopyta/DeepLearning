# Enhancing Performance on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 models

This repository contains my project on creating a deep learining model with the best accuracy on CIFAR-10 set using ResNet-18 architecture. It was a term project for Deep Learning course during my abroad studies at Kyungpook National University in South Korea. As a result I managed to obtain **97.43%** accuracy.

Since I do not own a device with GPU, I worked using Google Colab. Therefore, my code when not run in Google Colab environment, might require adjustments such us not mounting Google Drive and changing PATH for saving/loading the models.

**In the LMS assignment there was no posibillity of uploading the report.** Therefore I uploaded the report to the github repository.
